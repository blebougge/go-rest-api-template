# go-rest-api-template

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

Reusable template for building REST Web Services in Golang. Uses gorilla/mux as a router/dispatcher and Negroni as a middleware handler. Tested against Go 1.5.

## Introduction

### Why?

After writing many REST APIs with Java Dropwizard, Node.js/Express and Go, I wanted to distil my lessons learned into a reusable template for writing REST APIs, in the Go language (my favourite).

It's mainly for myself. I don't want to keep reinventing the wheel and just want to get the foundation of my REST API 'ready to go' so I can focus on the business logic and integration with other systems and data stores.

Just to be clear: this is not a framework, library, package or anything like that. This tries to use a couple of very good Go packages and libraries that I like and cobbled them together.

The main ones are:

* [gorilla/mux](http://www.gorillatoolkit.org/pkg/mux) for routing
* [negroni](https://github.com/codegangsta/negroni) as a middleware handler
* [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) for writing easier test assertions
* [godep](https://github.com/tools/godep) for dependency management
* [render](https://github.com/unrolled/render) for HTTP response rendering

Whilst working on this I've tried to write up as much as my thought process as possible. Everything from the design of the API and routes, some details of the Go code like JSON formatting in structs and my thoughts on testing. However, if you feel that there is something missing, send a PR, raise an issue or contact me on twitter [@leeprovoost](https://twitter.com/leeprovoost).

### Knowledge of Go

If you're new to programming in Go, I would highly recommend you to read the following two resources:

* [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)
* [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html)

You can work your way through those in two to three days. I wouldn't advise buying any books right now. I unfortunately did and I have yet to open them. If you really want to get some books, there is a [github](https://github.com/dariubs/GoBooks) repo that tries to list the main ones.

### Development tools

I've tried many different IDEs and it seems like it's a common Go newbie [frustration](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/6ZgrZsPzHr0). Coming from Java, I've tried "proper" IDEs like [LiteIDE](https://github.com/visualfc/liteide) and IntelliJ with the [golang plugin](https://github.com/go-lang-plugin-org/go-lang-idea-plugin) but never really fell in love with those.

I am a big fan of SublimeText that I've been using extensively for Node.js development so I set up my environment with:

* [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) editor
* [GoSublime](https://github.com/DisposaBoy/GoSublime) plugin
* [GitGutter](https://github.com/jisaacks/GitGutter) to see git diffs in gutter

I have tried Atom with the [go-plus](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus) in the past, but was never good enough to push Sublime Text aside for me. I have to admit that I haven't tried it in a while and Atom is maturing rapidly so please feel free to give it a go.

### How to run

`go run main.go` works fine if you have a single file you're working on, but once you have multiple files you'll have to start using the proper go build tool and run the compiled executable.

```
go build && ./go-rest-api-template
```

### Code Structure

Main server file (bootstrapping of http server and router):

```
main.go
```

Route handlers:

```
handlers.go
```

Data model descriptions:

```
passport.go
user.go
```

Mock database with operations:

```
database.go
```

Tests and test data:

```
database_test.go
fixtures.json
```

## Data

### Data model

We are going to use a travel Passport for our example. I've chosen Id as the unique key for the passport because (in the UK), passport book numbers these days have a unique 9 character field length (e.g. 012345678). A passport belongs to a user and a user can have one or more passports.

```
type User struct {
  Id              int       `json:"id"`
  FirstName       string    `json:"firstName"`
  LastName        string    `json:"lastName"`
  DateOfBirth     time.Time `json:"dateOfBirth"`
  LocationOfBirth string    `json:"locationOfBirth"`
}

type Passport struct {
  Id           string    `json:"id"`
  DateOfIssue  time.Time `json:"dateOfIssue"`
  DateOfExpiry time.Time `json:"dateOfExpiry"`
  Authority    string    `json:"authority"`
  UserId       int       `json:"userId"`
}
```

The first time you create a struct, you may not be aware that uppercasing and lowercasing your field names have a meaning in Go. It's similar to public and private members in Java. Uppercase = public, lowercase = private. There are some good discussions on Stackoverflow about [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21825322/why-golang-cannot-generate-json-from-struct-with-front-lowercase-character). The gist is that field names that start with a lowercase letter will not be visible to json.Marshal.

You may not want to expose your data to the consumer of your web service in this format, so you can override the way your fields are marshalled by adding ``json:"firstName"`` to each field with the desired name. I admit that in the past I had the habit of using underscores for my json field names, e.g. `first_name`. However after reading [this](http://www.slideshare.net/stormpath/rest-jsonapis) excellent presentation on API design, I got reminded that the JS in JSON stands for JavaScript and in the JavaScript world, it's common to use camelCasing so the preffered way of writing the same fieldname would be: `firstName`.

Note the use of `time.Time` for the dates instead of using a standard `string` type. We'll discuss the pain of marshalling and unmarshalling of JSON dates a bit later.

### Operations on our (mock) database

I wanted to create a template REST API that didn't depend on a database, so started with a simple in-memory database that we can work with. The good thing is that this will be the start of a so-called data access layer that abstracts away the underlying data store. We can achieve that by starting with creating an interface (which is a good practice in Go anyway):

```
type DataStore interface {
  List() (map[string]User, error)
  Get(i int) (User, error)
  Add(u User) (User, error)
  Update(u User) (User, error)
  Delete(i int) (bool, error)
}
```

This allows us to define a set of operations on the data as a contract, without people having to worry about the actual implementation of how the data is stored and accessed. I've added the basic operations to list, retrieve, create, update and delete data, so the standard CRUD-style operations (accepting that CRUD has some subtle differences with REST).

Let's have a look at the type signature of the `Get` operation:

```
Get(i int) (User, error)
```

What this tells us is that it is expecting an integer as an argument (which will be the User id in our case), and returns a pair of values: a user object and an error object. Returning pairs of values is a nice Go feature and is often used to return information about errors.

An example of how this could be used is the following:

```
user, err := db.Get(uid)
if err == nil {
  Render.JSON(w, http.StatusOK, user)
} else {
  Render.JSON(w, http.StatusNotFound, err)
}
```

We check whether the error object is nil. If it is, then we return a HTTP 200 OK, if not then we return HTTP 404 NOT FOUND. Let's go into more detail when we talk about our API handlers.

Let's have a look at the actual mock in-memory database. We need to create a Database struct that will hold the data:

```
type Database struct {
  UserList  map[int]User
  MaxUserID int
}
```
The UserList will hold a list of User structs and the MaxUserID holds the latest used integer. MaxUserID mimicks the behaviour of an autogenerated ID in conventional databases. In this case MaxUserID represents the highest used database ID.

We will now create a global database variable so that it's accessible across our whole API:

```
var db *Database
```

Which gets initalised in our `main.go` init function:

```
func init() {
  // ...
  list := make(map[int]User)
  list[0] = jsonObject["users"][0]
  list[1] = jsonObject["users"][1]
  db = &Database{
    UserList:  list,
    MaxUserID: 1,
  }
}
```

This creates a map of User objects with an integer key, creates two items and then creates the Database object with the list and sets the new user ID to 1.

### Fixtures

In order to make it a bit more useful, we will initialise it with some user objects. Luckily, we can make use of the `init` function that gets automatically called when you start the application. This init() function will be in our `main.go` file when you start up the server:

```
func init() {
  // read JSON fixtures file
  var jsonObject map[string][]User
  file, err := ioutil.ReadFile("./fixtures.json")
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("File error: %v\n", err)
  }
  err = json.Unmarshal(file, &jsonObject)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  // load data in database
  list := make(map[int]User)
  list[0] = jsonObject["users"][0]
  list[1] = jsonObject["users"][1]
  db = &Database{list, 1}
}
```

We are first going to load the data from a `fixtures.json` file:

```
{
  "users": [
    {
        "dateOfBirth": "1985-12-31T00:00:00Z",
        "firstName": "John",
        "id": 0,
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "locationOfBirth": "London"
    },
    {
        "dateOfBirth": "1992-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "firstName": "Jane",
        "id": 1,
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "locationOfBirth": "Milton Keynes"
    }
  ]
}
```

When we can't load the file, we will stop the bootstrapping of the application. This is taken care of by Go's log handler, which fires off a fatal error:

```
file, err := ioutil.ReadFile("./fixtures.json")
if err != nil {
  log.Fatalf("File error: %v\n", err)
}
```

The `fixtures.json` file contains a JSON representation of a Go map where the key is a string (i.e. `"users"`) and the map value is a string of User objects. In Go, this would be respresented as: `map[string][]User`. We load the fixtures file, marshal it into the type we just defined and then load it into our database.

The date string looks a bit odd. Why not just use `31-12-1985` or `1985-12-31`? The first is discouraged altogether because that's an European way of writing dates and will cause confusion around the world. Not this particular example, but imagine you have 3-4-2015. Is it third of April or fourth of March? Unfortunately there isn't an "enforced standard" for dates in JSON, so I've tried to use one that is commonly used and also understood by Go's `json.Marshaler` and `json.Unmarshaler` to avoid that we have to write our own custom marshaler/unarshaler.

If you have a look at Go's `time/format` [code](http://golang.org/src/time/format.go) then you'll see on line 54:

```
54    RFC3339     = "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00"
```

That's the one we need. It has the following format:

```
year-month-day
T (for time)
hour:minutes:seconds
Z (for time zone)
offset from UTC
```

We now need to implement the various methods from our DataStore interface.

## Defining the API

### API Routes

Now that we have defined the data access layer, we need to translate that to a REST interface:

* Retrieve a list of all users: `GET /users` -> The `GET` just refers to the HTTP action you would use. If you want to test this in the command line, then you can use curl: `curl -X GET http://localhost:3009/users` or `curl -X POST http://localhost:3009/users`
* Retrieve the details of an individual user: `GET /users/{uid}` -> {uid} allows us to create a variable, named uid, that we can use in our code. An example of this url would be `GET /users/1`
* Create a new user: `POST /users`
* Update a user: `PUT /users/{uid}`
* Delete a user: `DELETE /users/{uid}`

We now need to do the same for handling passports. Don't forget that a passport belongs to a user, so to retrieve a list of all passports for a given user, we would use `GET /users/{uid}/passports`.

When we want to retrieve an specific passport, we don't need to prefix the route with `/users/{uid}` anymore because we know exactly which passport we want to retrieve. So, instead of `GET /users/{uid}/passports/{pid}`, we can just use `GET /passports/{pid}`.

Once you have the API design sorted, it's just a matter of creating the code that gets called when a specific route is hit. We implement those with Handlers.

```
router.HandleFunc("/users", makeHandler(env, ListUsersHandler)).Methods("GET")
router.HandleFunc("/users/{uid:[0-9]+}", makeHandler(env, GetUserHandler)).Methods("GET")
router.HandleFunc("/users", makeHandler(env, CreateUserHandler)).Methods("POST")
router.HandleFunc("/users/{uid:[0-9]+}", makeHandler(env, UpdateUserHandler)).Methods("PUT")
router.HandleFunc("/users/{uid:[0-9]+}", makeHandler(env, DeleteUserHandler)).Methods("DELETE")

router.HandleFunc("/users/{uid}/passports", makeHandler(env, PassportsHandler)).Methods("GET")
router.HandleFunc("/passports/{pid:[0-9]+}", makeHandler(env, PassportsHandler)).Methods("GET")
router.HandleFunc("/users/{uid}/passports", makeHandler(env, PassportsHandler)).Methods("POST")
router.HandleFunc("/passports/{pid:[0-9]+}", makeHandler(env, PassportsHandler)).Methods("PUT")
router.HandleFunc("/passports/{pid:[0-9]+}", makeHandler(env, PassportsHandler)).Methods("DELETE")
```

In order to make our code more robust, I've added pattern matching in the routes.  This `[0-9]+` pattern says that we only accept digits from 0 to 9 and we can have one or more digits. Everything else will most likely trigger an HTTP 404 Not Found status code being returned to the client.

### API Handlers

Most Go code that show HandleFunc examples, will show something slightly different, something more like this:

```
router.HandleFunc("/users", ListUsersHandler).Methods("GET")
```

So Go's HandleFunc function takes two arguments, one string that defines the route and a second argument of the type `http.HandleFunc(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)`. This works very well, but doesn't allow you to pass any extra data to your handlers. So for instance when you want to use the `unrolled/render` package, then you'd have to define in your `main.go` file a global variable like this: `var Render  *render.Render`, then initialise that in your `func main()` so that your handlers can access this global variable later on. Using global variables in Go is not a good practice (there are exceptions like certain database drivers, but that's a different discussion).

So our initial handler function for returning a list of users was:

```
func ListUsersHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
  Render.JSON(w, http.StatusOK, db.List())
}
```

Where the `Render` variable is a global variable. We'd prefer to pass the Render variable to that function so will rewrite it to:

```
func ListUsersHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request, render Render) {
  render.JSON(w, http.StatusOK, db.List())
}
```

Perfect. Or, is it? What if we want to pass more variables to the handler function? Like Metrics? Or some environment variables? We'd continuously have to change ALL our handlers and the type signature will become quite long and hard to maintain. An alternative is to create a server or an environment struct and use that as a container for our variables we want to pass around the system.

In our `main.go` we'd add:

```
type Env struct {
  Metrics *stats.Stats
  Render  *render.Render
}
```

And in our `func main()` function we initialise that struct:

```
func main() {
  env := Env{
    Metrics: stats.New(),
    Render:  render.New(),
  }
  // ...
}
```

Our handler looks now like this:

```
func ListUsersHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request, env Env) {
  env.Render.JSON(w, http.StatusOK, db.List())
}
```

The only problem is that this handler's type signature is not `http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request` but `http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request, Env` so Go's HandleFunc function will complain about this. That's why we are introducing a helper function `makeHandler` that takes our environment struct and our handlers with the special type signature and converts it to `func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)`:

```
func makeHandler(env Env, fn func(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request, Env)) http.HandlerFunc {
  return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fn(w, r, env)
  }
}
```

### Special Routes

When you look at the overview of the handlers in `main.go`, you will notice a couple of special routes:

```
router.HandleFunc("/", makeHandler(env, HomeHandler))
router.HandleFunc("/healthcheck", makeHandler(env, HealthcheckHandler)).Methods("GET")
router.HandleFunc("/metrics", makeHandler(env, MetricsHandler)).Methods("GET")
```

When someone hits our API, without a specified route, then we can handle that with either a standard 404 (not found), or any other type of feedback.

We also want to set up a health check that monitoring tools like [Sensu](https://sensuapp.org/) can call: `GET /healthcheck`. The health check route can return a 204 OK when the serivce is up and running, including some extra stats. A 204 means "Hey, I got your request, all is fine and I have nothing else to say". It essentially tells your client that there is no body content.

```
func HealthcheckHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request, env Env) {
  env.Render.Text(w, http.StatusNoContent, "")
}
```

This health check is very simple. It just checks whether the service is up and running, which can be useful in a build and deployment pipelines where you can check whether your newly deployed API is running (as part of a smoke test). More advanced health checks will also check whether it can reach the database, message queue or anything else you'd like to check. Trust me, your DevOps colleagues will be very grateful for this. (Don't forget to change your HTTP status code to 200 if you want to report on the various components that your health check is checking.)

We will skip the `/metrics` route for a second and keep that for the end of the article.

### Returning Data

Let's have a look at interacting with our data. Returning a list of users is quite easy, it's just showing the UserList:

```
func ListUsersHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request, env Env) {
  env.Render.JSON(w, http.StatusOK, db.List())
}
```

BTW, notice the `Render.JSON`? That's part of `"github.com/unrolled/render"` and allows us to render JSON output when we send data back to the client.

So, this will return the following to the client:

```
{
    "users": [
        {
            "dateOfBirth": "1992-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "firstName": "Jane",
            "id": 1,
            "lastName": "Doe",
            "locationOfBirth": "Milton Keynes"
        },
        {
            "dateOfBirth": "1985-12-31T00:00:00Z",
            "firstName": "John",
            "id": 0,
            "lastName": "Doe",
            "locationOfBirth": "London"
        }
    ]
}
```

It may surprise you that we are returning a JSON object that holds an array with multiple JSON objects, rather than an array with multiple JSON objects, as seen in the example below:

```
{
    [
        {
            "dateOfBirth": "1992-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "firstName": "Jane",
            "id": 1,
            "lastName": "Doe",
            "locationOfBirth": "Milton Keynes"
        },
        {
            "dateOfBirth": "1985-12-31T00:00:00Z",
            "firstName": "John",
            "id": 0,
            "lastName": "Doe",
            "locationOfBirth": "London"
        }
    ]
}
```

They're both valid and there are lots of views and opinions (as always in developer / architecture communities!), but the reason why I prefer to wrap the array in a JSON object is because later on we can easily add more data without causing significant changes to the client. What if we want to add the concept of pagination to our API?

Example:

```
{
    "offset": 0,
    "limit":  25,
    "users":  [
        {
            "dateOfBirth": "1992-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "firstName": "Jane",
            "id": 1,
            "lastName": "Doe",
            "locationOfBirth": "Milton Keynes"
        },
        {
            "dateOfBirth": "1985-12-31T00:00:00Z",
            "firstName": "John",
            "id": 0,
            "lastName": "Doe",
            "locationOfBirth": "London"
        }
    ]
}
```

Another example is the retrieval of a specific object:

```
func GetUserHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request, env Env) {
  vars := mux.Vars(req)
  uid, _ := strconv.Atoi(vars["uid"])
  user, err := db.Get(uid)
  if err == nil {
    env.Render.JSON(w, http.StatusOK, user)
  } else {
    env.Render.JSON(w, http.StatusNotFound, err)
  }
}
```

This reads the uid variable from the route (`/users/{uid}`), converts the string to an integer and then looks up the user in our UserList by ID. If the user does not exit, we return a 404 and an error object. If the user exists, we return a 200 and a JSON object with the user.

Example:

```
{
    "dateOfBirth": "1992-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "id": 1,
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "locationOfBirth": "Milton Keynes"
}
```

We add the attributes of the user object to the root of the JSON response, rather than wrapping it up in an explicit JSON object. I can quite easily add extra data to the response, without breaking the existing data.

## Testing

### Manually testing your API routes with curl commands

Let's start with some simple curl tests. Open your terminal and try the following curl commands.

Retrieve a list of users:

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:3009/users | python -mjson.tool
```

That should result in the following result:

```
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   216  100   216    0     0  14466      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 15428
{
    "users": [
        {
            "dateOfBirth": "1992-01-01T00:00:00Z",
            "firstName": "Jane",
            "id": 1,
            "lastName": "Doe",
            "locationOfBirth": "Milton Keynes"
        },
        {
            "dateOfBirth": "1985-12-31T00:00:00Z",
            "firstName": "John",
            "id": 0,
            "lastName": "Doe",
            "locationOfBirth": "London"
        }
    ]
}
```

The `| python -mjson.tool` at the end is for pretty printing (formatting). It essentially tells to pipe the output of the curl command to the SJON formatting tool. If we only typed `curl -X GET http://localhost:3009/users` then we'd have something like this:

```
{"users":[{"id":0,"firstName":"John","lastName":"Doe","dateOfBirth":"1985-12-31T00:00:00Z","locationOfBirth":"London"},{"id":1,"firstName":"Jane","lastName":"Doe","dateOfBirth":"1992-01-01T00:00:00Z","locationOfBirth":"Milton Keynes"}]}
```

So not that easy to read as the earlier nicely formatted example.

Get a specific user:

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:3009/users/0 | python -mjson.tool
```

Results in:

```
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   104  100   104    0     0   6625      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  6933
{
    "dateOfBirth": "1992-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "id": 1,
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "locationOfBirth": "Milton Keynes"
}
```

### Automating the API tests

### Testing the Database

There are lots of opinions on testing, how much you should be testing, which layers of your applications, etc. When I'm working with micro services, I tend to focus on two types of tests to start with: testing the data access layer and testing the actual HTTP service.

In this example, we want to test the List, Add, Get, Update and Delete operations on our in-memory document database. The data access code is stored in the `database.go` file, so following Go convention we will create a new file called `database_test.go`.

In the `database_test.go` file, we have two sections:

First, we're going to create a common initialiser, this code sets up our database, inserts a couple of test records and then fires off the tests:

```
func TestMain(m *testing.M) {
  list := make(map[int]User)
  list[0] = User{0, "John", "Doe", "1985-12-31T00:00:00Z", "London"}
  list[1] = User{1, "Jane", "Doe", "1992-01-01T00:00:00Z", "Milton Keynes"}
  db = &Database{list, 1}
  retCode := m.Run()
  os.Exit(retCode)
}
```
Once this is ready, we can start writing tests. Let's have a look at the easiest one where we list the elements in our database:

```
func TestList(t *testing.T) {
  list := db.List()
  count := len(list["users"])
  assert.Equal(t, 2, count, "There should be 2 items in the list.")
}
```

This first calls the `db.List()` function, which returns a list of users. We then count the number of elements and last but not least we then check whether that count equals 2.

In standard Go, you would actually write something like:

```
if 2 != count {
  t.Errorf("Expected 2 elements in the list, instead got %v", count)
}
```

However there is a neat Go package called [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) that gives you assertions like Java and that's why we can write cleaner test code like:

```
assert.Equal(t, 2, count, "There should be 2 items in the list.")
```

The `TestList` is only testing for a positive result, but we really need to test for failures as well.

This is our test code for the Delete functionality:

```
func TestDeleteSuccess(t *testing.T) {
  ok, err := db.Delete(1)
  assert.Equal(t, true, ok, "they should be equal")
  assert.Nil(t, err)
}

func TestDeleteFail(t *testing.T) {
  ok, err := db.Delete(10)
  assert.Equal(t, false, ok, "they should be equal")
  assert.NotNil(t, err)
}
```

The first test function `TestDeleteSuccess` tries to delete a known existing user, with Id 1. We're expecting that the error object is Nil. The second test function `TestDeleteFail` tries to look up a non-existing user with Id 10, and as expected, this should return an actual Error object.

How do we run the tests?

Simple:

```
go test
```

If you want it more verbose, then:

```
go test -v
```

Which will give you:

```
=== RUN TestList
--- PASS: TestList (0.00s)
=== RUN TestGetSuccess
--- PASS: TestGetSuccess (0.00s)
=== RUN TestGetFail
--- PASS: TestGetFail (0.00s)

=== RUN TestDeleteFail
--- PASS: TestDeleteFail (0.00s)
PASS
ok    github.com/leeprovoost/go-rest-api-template 0.008s
```

Do you want to get some more info on your code coverage? No worries, Go has you covered (no pun intended):

```
go test -cover
```

This will give you:

```
PASS
coverage: 34.9% of statements
ok    github.com/leeprovoost/go-rest-api-template 0.009s
```

## Environment Variables

## Metrics

Something that is often overlooked is ensuring that you have a deep insight in your application metrics. I admit that in the past I was mainly looking at server metrics like memory consumption, CPU usage, swap, etc. Once I started building micro-services using Coda Hale's excelent Java [Dropwizard framework](http://www.dropwizard.io/), I got to know his [metrics](https://dropwizard.github.io/metrics/3.1.0/) library that gave me insight in the application and JVM metrics as an engineer.

As a start, you could look into two metrics: average response times for either your whole APU (or for a specific route) and the various HTTP status codes being returned. The important thing here is that you hook this up with a monitoring tool (e.g. Sensu) so that the tool periodically pings your metrics endpoint (in this example: http://localhost:3009/metrics) and look at trends. We're less interested in an individual snapshot. We will always have the occasional HTTP 404 being returend. However, if after a deployment you start seeing a spike in HTTP 404 codes being returned, then that should give you an indication that something might be wrong.

I experimented a bit with the [`thoas/stats`])https://github.com/thoas/stats) package but admit that I haven't used it in anger in a production enviornment.

We will first add the stats as a variable, named Metrics, to our environment struct:

```
type Env struct {
  Metrics *stats.Stats
  Render  *render.Render
}
```

Then initialise the variable in our main function (in `main.go`):

```
func main() {
  env := Env{
    Metrics: stats.New(),
    Render:  render.New(),
  }
  router := mux.NewRouter()
  // ...
}
```

The actual handler is pretty simple. In `handlers.go`, we add a handler called `MetricsHandler` and that just gets the data from our environment, renders it into a JSON format and returns an HTTP 200 OK status:

```
func MetricsHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request, env Env) {
  stats := env.Metrics.Data()
  env.Render.JSON(w, http.StatusOK, stats)
}
```

If you curl the Metrics endpoint:

```
curl -X GET http://localhost:3009/metrics | python -mjson.tool
```

Then you should receive the following response:

```
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   392  100   392    0     0  27724      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 28000
{
    "average_response_time": "93.247\u00b5s",
    "average_response_time_sec": 9.324700000000001e-05,
    "count": 0,
    "pid": 71093,
    "status_code_count": {},
    "time": "2015-09-16 08:27:26.958487627 +0100 BST",
    "total_count": 15,
    "total_response_time": "1.398705ms",
    "total_response_time_sec": 0.001398705,
    "total_status_code_count": {
        "200": 14,
        "404": 1
    },
    "unixtime": 1442388446,
    "uptime": "3m53.321206056s",
    "uptime_sec": 233.321206056
}
```

You can start monitoring the response codes for instance. Let's say you get all of a sudden a spike in HTTP 404 messages, that might point to a failed deployment or a failing back-end service:

```
"total_status_code_count": {
    "200": 14,
    "404": 1
},
```
